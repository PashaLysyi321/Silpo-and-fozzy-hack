We took second place in the competition with the idea of ​​making a quick and convenient product assistant. 
The application accepts a barcode and as a result we see all the information about the product - the composition (visual division of products into useful and others). 
You can also enter a product that you do not consume (diet, allergen, diseases, personal preferences), 
and our software, if it finds this product in the composition, will emphasize it. 
Thus, the user does not need to view the entire composition on his own, he immediately sees whether this product is suitable for him.
Additionally, our app shows you how to recycle the product.
The goal of the project is to increase the eco-awareness of guests and get the user to care about the environment. 
A shot from app attached. IOS demo and source code u can find here:
